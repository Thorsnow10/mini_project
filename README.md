Problem Statement:

Lithium-ion batteries are integral to modern devices, but their operation is fraught with risks such as thermal runaway, overvoltage, and firmware manipulation. The case of a compromised BMS leading to an explosion underscores the need for robust safety mechanisms and secure firmware designs. This project tackled these challenges by implementing a secure BMS that safeguards both physical safety and firmware integrity.
